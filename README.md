# Computing the Riemann Constant Vector

Authors: Bernard Deconinck, Matthew S. Patterson, and Christopher Swierczewski

## Abstract

The Riemann constant vector is a fundamental ingredient in the study of Riemann
surfaces and their Jacobians. It is necessary to discuss the Jacobi inversion
problem, for the study of the theta divisor, and for periodic solutions to
integrable partial differential equations.

We present a mathematical algorithm and an implementation for computing the
Riemann constant vector on a Riemann surface given by the desingularization and
compactification of a complex plane algebraic curve. The source code of the
implementation is provided in the Python software package `abelfunctions`.
